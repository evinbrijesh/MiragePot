# Alertmanager configuration for MiragePot
# This is a minimal config for portfolio/demo purposes.
# For production use, add Slack/Discord/Email receivers.

global:
  # Resolve timeout - how long to wait before marking alert as resolved
  resolve_timeout: 5m

# Routing configuration
route:
  # Default receiver for all alerts
  receiver: 'default'
  
  # Group alerts by these labels
  group_by: ['alertname', 'cluster', 'severity']

  group_wait: 10s
  
  # Wait time before sending batch of new alerts

    # Critical security threats

# Receiver definitions
receivers:
  # Default receiver - logs only (no external services required)
  # Alerts will be visible in Alertmanager UI at http://localhost:9093
  - name: 'default'
    # No configs = alerts are stored/visible in Alertmanager UI only
    # This is ideal for demo/portfolio purposes
