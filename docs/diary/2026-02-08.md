# Development Diary - February 8, 2026

## Summary

Major session focused on making MiragePot demo-ready with complete Docker deployment, offline capabilities, and comprehensive documentation.

---

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Full Stack Docker Deployment

**Created complete 5-container monitoring stack:**

| Container | Purpose | Port |
|-----------|---------|------|
| miragepot-honeypot | SSH honeypot + Streamlit dashboard | 2222, 8501, 9090 |
| miragepot-ollama | AI model (phi3) for adaptive responses | 11434 (internal) |
| miragepot-prometheus | Metrics collection | 9091 |
| miragepot-grafana | Visualization dashboards | 3000 |
| miragepot-alertmanager | Alert management | 9093 |

**Files created/modified:**
- `docker/docker-compose.yml` - Full stack configuration
- `docker/prometheus/prometheus.yml` - Prometheus config
- `docker/prometheus/alertmanager.yml` - Simplified for demo use (no external services)
- `grafana/dashboards/` - 3 pre-built dashboards (Overview, TTP Analysis, Performance)
- `miragepot/metrics.py` - Prometheus metrics integration
- Updated `miragepot/server.py`, `command_handler.py`, `ai_interface.py` with metrics

### 2. Offline Deployment Solution

**Problem:** Demo venues (conferences, classrooms) may have poor or no internet.

**Solution created:**
- `docs/OFFLINE_DEPLOYMENT.md` (588 lines) - Complete guide for creating and deploying offline bundle
- `scripts/export-offline.sh` - Automated script to create portable bundle (~6-7GB)

**Bundle contents:**
- Docker images (~4GB)
- Ollama phi3 model (~2GB)
- Complete source code
- Checksums for integrity verification

### 3. Demo Walkthrough Documentation

**Created:** `docs/DEMO_WALKTHROUGH.md` (645 lines)

**Contents:**
- 10-15 minute presentation script for CS audiences
- Pre-demo checklist
- Live attack simulation guide
- Technical deep dives for Q&A
- Common questions with prepared answers
- Troubleshooting during live demos

### 4. Documentation Consistency Fixes

**Problems found and fixed:**

1. **GitHub URLs had placeholder:**
   - Before: `https://github.com/yourusername/MiragePot.git`
   - After: `https://github.com/evinbrijesh/MiragePot.git`
   - Files fixed: `docs/QUICK_START.md`, `docs/DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md`

2. **Inconsistent deployment recommendations:**
   - Before: Simple Stack and Full Stack presented as equal options
   - After: Full Stack is primary recommendation, Simple Stack moved to "Advanced" section
   - Files restructured: `docs/QUICK_START.md`, `README.md`

## Current Project State

### Docker Stack Status
All 5 containers running successfully:
- Honeypot: healthy
- Ollama: running (phi3 model loaded)
- Prometheus: collecting metrics
- Grafana: dashboards provisioned
- Alertmanager: configured

### Access URLs
- SSH Honeypot: `ssh root@localhost -p 2222`
- Streamlit Dashboard: http://localhost:8501
- Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9091
- Alertmanager: http://localhost:9093

### Test Status
- All 566 unit tests passing
- SSH honeypot responding correctly
- Metrics endpoint working
- Full stack deployment verified

---

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Target audience:** CS students/professionals (technical documentation appropriate)
2. **Deployment focus:** Full Stack is primary, Simple Stack kept for backward compatibility
3. **Offline requirement:** Critical for demo scenarios - solved with export script
4. **Documentation style:** Text-only with ASCII diagrams (no images yet)

---

## Next Steps (Potential)

- [ ] Test offline export script end-to-end
- [ ] Consider removing `docker-compose-simple.yml` if focusing only on Full Stack
- [ ] Move `run.py` to `scripts/` for better organization
- [ ] Add actual image diagrams to documentation
- [ ] Create quick reference card (1-page cheat sheet)

## Notes

- Project is now demo-ready for CS colleagues and professors
- Offline deployment capability enables presentations at venues without reliable internet
- Full monitoring stack demonstrates production-readiness
